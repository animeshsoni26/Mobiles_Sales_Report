## Root Cause Analysis & Solutions
### Q1: Low Inventory Turnover  
- **Cause:** Stocking based on historical averages (64%) vs. live demand.  
- **Solution:** Real-time **12-week demand forecasting** + automated reorder logic.  

### Q2: Tier-2 City Underperformance  
- **Cause:** Lack of localized campaigns & weak inventory visibility.  
- **Solution:** **Regional influencers, localized offers, and flexible pricing.**  

### Q3: Low Customer Retention & NPS  
- **Cause:** Delayed resolutions, unclear escalation, no follow-up.  
- **Solution:** **Tiered complaint dashboard, 48-hr SLA, feedback prompts.**  

### Q4: Uneven Product Category Performance  
- **Cause:** 30% shelf space wasted on low-conversion SKUs.  
- **Solution:** **Auto-deactivate low SKUs, reallocate to high-margin items.**  

### Q5: Underutilized Digital Payments  
- **Cause:** Only 12% of campaigns feature payment offers.  
- **Solution:** **UPI/wallet partnerships with integrated offers.**  

### Q6: Low Marketing ROI  
- **Cause:** 45% of campaigns misaligned with demand peaks.  
- **Solution:** **Heatmap-driven scheduling + urgency-based CTAs.**  

### Q7: Low Staff Motivation  
- **Cause:** No structured incentives in underperforming regions.  
- **Solution:** **Gamified micro-incentives + leaderboards.**  

### Q8: High Digital Cart Abandonment  
- **Cause:** Unclear refund/return policies, no reminders.  
- **Solution:** **Refund policy visibility + live chat + timed reminders.**  

### Q9: Mid-Range Segment Not Scaling  
- **Cause:** Weak promotions for stocked brands (Xiaomi, Vivo).  
- **Solution:** **EMI-based offers, influencer campaigns, festive bundling.**
